CHECK ENTITY WITH DB IF CORRECT (MOSTLY IS ?? - BUT SOME SPECIFICS FOR EXAMPLE NEED TO CREATE AN APPUSER BEFORE CANDIDAT / ENTRPRISE - CHECK EDGE CASES)
CHECK DAO IF COMPLETE FOR USE CASE (MOSTLY IS ???)

CHECK CONTROLLER IF WORKING (MOSTLY IS NOT ??? -- get are nices but other are not - and did not add one thing to db yet)


> FIRST MEED TO CHANGE APPUSER SO IT DOESN"T HAVE CANDIDAT NOR ENTREPRIOSE ATTRIBUT AS THEY DON'T EXIST WHEN APPUSER CREATED
FIXED A BIT BY REMOVING CHECK BUT NOT NICE FOR NOW
>>>> CAN ADD APPUSER BUT NO ENTREPRISE OR CANDIDAT SO NO FURTHER <<<<<
